AuctionSim - First-Time Setup
=============================

AuctionSim runs a bot character that lists and buys items on the Auction House 
so a low-population realm still has a busy AH.

Everything in this window is saved to auctionsim.conf. You do not need to edit
that file by hand.


1. Requirements
---------------
- A character for the bot to use. A dedicated character on its own account is
  best, but any character works - including the one you are logged in on right
  now.
- Two-side auction interaction must be OFF in worldserver.conf:
      AllowTwoSide.Interaction.Auction = 0
  The module refuses to start otherwise.
- You must be a GM to open this window (/auctionsim or /ahsim).


2. Point the module at the bot character
----------------------------------------
- Click "Set Bot Char".
- Type the character's name and click Okay.
- The server looks the character up, writes its character id and account id to
  auctionsim.conf, and - if the module is already enabled - switches the running
  bot to it right away. No restart needed.
- Success, or the reason it failed, shows in the Results box.


3. Enable the module
--------------------
- Tick "Enabled". It saves immediately and starts the bot.
- Optionally tick "Startup Scan" to run a scan automatically on every server
  start.


4. Choose what the bot lists
----------------------------
In the "Listing Multipliers" grid on the right:

- Max Required Level / Max Item Level: the bot skips items above these. 0 means
  no limit.
- The bot works out how full to keep each category and quality from real auction
  scan data. Each grid cell scales that target: 1 matches the real market, 1.5
  keeps it 50% fuller, 0.5 half as full, 0 disables that cell. Enter a plain
  number like 1, 1.5 or 0.25.
- The scan data was taken from a realm with a saturated auction house, so the
  default values are scaled down.
- When editing a cell you must press enter to apply the change.
- Click "Apply" to send your changes, then "Save To File" to write them to
  auctionsim.conf.
- "Refresh" reloads the values from the server and discards unsaved edits.

5. First run
------------
- Click "Scan". The bot lists new auctions and queues items to buy. Queued buys
  are spread over time, not done all at once.
- Note: Searching the auction house after running a scan while logged in as the
  bot character can take a little while for the auction db to update if there are
  a lot of new auctions.
- After that the module scans on its own on a timer.


Button reference
----------------

Help            This window.


Notes
-----
- Mail the bot would get from its own auctions is discarded automatically.
- Everything set here is written to auctionsim.conf, so it survives a restart.
